Focus on showing and not just telling
Give dramatic demonstrations to create trust and certainty in the buyers mind
Give eye-catching displays
Demonstrate something unexpected to create a memorable impression
How to ensure they can trust us, understand we are competent, understand what makes us special vs competitors
Emphasize trust
Competence
Uniqueness

Understand the difference between Selling and closing
Real success comes from closing, not selling
A seller employs pushy or aggressive tactics to make a sale
A closer focuses on building trust and providing value to the point the buyer thanks them for helping make a decision
Give more value than what is being charged for the product or service to make it a no-brainer
Emphasize with the customer
Deep empathy is crucial
Genuinely care about the customer and the results and the product
Uncover challenges or pain points for the buyer with their current process
Ensure to address the prospects needs as opposed to just pushing a products features
Assert flexibility and adaptability

Avoid these words
To be honest with you - it implies you haven't been honest previously
Trust me - this can diminish trust as opposed to building it
Sorry to bother you
Just following up - can trigger resistance as it is often associated with a sales pitch
Buy - this word emphasizes the act of spending money, use the word “own” instead
Contract - this word is intimidating and heavy, use alternatives like ‘agreement’ or ‘paperwork’
I haven’t heard back from you - This phrase makes the prospect feel guilty
Don't refer to them as an individual
Don't say ‘we are better than’ - putting down competitors can actually backfire, just focus on understanding the prospects needs and offering better solutions
Say would you like to own this instead of do you want to buy this

Have a clear outcome with what you want to achieve 
Have a clear objective
Ask “What motivated you to meet with us today” - this helps you understand the prospects motives for the meeting
Ask “Exactly what are we trying to accomplish today” - this focuses on setting clear goals for the meeting
Ask “Where are you today and where do you want to be?” - This identifies the current status and desired future state of the prospect
“What seems to be the problem, and how long have you had this challenge” - this helps uncover the prospects pain points and the duration of their challenges
“If this meeting accomplished everything you could possibly hope for, what would that look like” - this question helps visualize the ideal outcome of the meeting for the prospect
People don't buy if there is no need or low need, if there is no urgency, if there is no desire, if there is no money, or if there is no trust.
